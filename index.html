<h1><strong>About me</strong></h1>

<hr>



<p> My name is Derrick and I'm in the process of re-eventing myself. And the way I'm going about it will be very challenging and yet strengthening. Not only am I doing this for myself, but I'm also doing this for my family as well, and hopefully I will inspire others to take a chance to dream big and follow there hearts and goals along the way. </p>

<p> All my life I worked jobs that I felt where in my optinon "manly  jobs". Like being a mover, machine operator, and construction worker. Even though I didn't mind doing these jobs I felt like I'm getting nowhere fast. So on top of getting injured on my last job and having really no experience doing anything other than laboring job,  I felt it's time for a serious career change. After entering a program so what like the one (bootcamp style), I received my CompTIA A+ certificate and got my foot in the IT door as  a compture repair technician. Still not really happy with where I'm at  I decided to apply for the coding boot-camp at the U of M. With that being said, here I am.</p>
